      <h2>Introducing:<br> The Complete Guide to Rails Performance</h2>

      <p>
        My name is Nate Berkopec. I'm a Rails developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the past 4 years, I've seen dozens of different Rails codebases. Many were for well-funded startups, from Ivy-League incubators like YCombinator or 500Startups. Others were the passion projects of developers looking to start a side business.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I've never met a Rails application that couldn't be faster.
      </p>

      <h4>What do I consider fast?</h4>

      <p>What do I consider to be a "fast" Rails application? Here's some numbers.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>App server average response time</th>
          <th>Status</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> < 50ms</td>
          <td>Fast!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> < 300ms</td>
          <td>Average</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> >= 300ms</td>
          <td>Slow!</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Of course, those numbers are just rules of thumb for Rails applications
        that serve up HTML - your typical "Basecamp-style" application.
        For simple API servers that serve JSON only, I might divide by 2, for example.
      </p>

      <p>And for the frontend, here's what I'd expect to see:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Browser load time</th>
          <th>Status</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> < 500ms</td>
          <td>Fast!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> < 2 seconds</td>
          <td>Average</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> > 2 seconds</td>
          <td>Slow!</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        These are the numbers I'd expect to see in Google Analytic's Site Speed
        Tool or New Relic's Browser analytics. This is *not* the load times I'd
        expect from checking your site load in your local browser - most people's
        machines and internet connections are slower than your average developer's!
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're in the "GOOD" region of these numbers, well, congrats - this
        course won't help you. But if you're in the "AVERAGE" to "BAD" group,
        well, then I think have some things I can teach you.
      </p>

      <h4>Performance is hard. Let me help you.</h4>

      <p>
        Performance isn't easy. Delivering an HTML response to the browser actually involves hundreds of technologies and levels of the stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        Any of these levels or stacks can go wrong, causing a slowdown in your application:
      </p>

      <div class="mini-list padding-md row row-wrap">
        <div class="column column-50">
          <div class="icon-list-item">
            <h4>Front-end</h4>
            <span>HTML, CSS and JavaScript, rendering quirks and browser preloaders.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-50">
          <div class="icon-list-item">
            <h4>Network</h4>
            <span>SSL/TLS, HTTP, HTTP/2, TCP, WebSockets.</span>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column column-50">
          <div class="icon-list-item">
            <h4>Ruby</h4>
            <span>Rails, the numerous gems you use in your application, and your runtime.</span>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="icon-list-item">
            <h4>Server</h4>

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        This makes performance optimization something like looking for a needle in a haystack - any one of a thousand things could be the bottleneck for your application. Where do you even start?
      </p>

      <p>
        Worse, no full-stack developer that has to write code for a living can keep on top of all of these developments at once. No one has ever written a guide for optimizing Rails applications that covers the entire stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Wouldn't it be amazing if you could look over the shoulder of an experienced, full-stack Rails developer</b> and watch as they diagnose and solve the performance problems of one of the most popular Rails applications in the world?
      </p>

      <p>
        That's exactly what I've done.
      </p>

      <h2 class="margin-md">WATCH ME OPTIMIZE PRODUCTION RAILS APPS AND APPLY THE LESSONS BACK TO YOUR OWN SITE.</h2>

      <p>I’ve created what is basically an enormous checklist for speeding up Rails applications:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Implemented 34 strategies</b> that have been tested by more than 1 million unique visitors.</li>
        <li><b>Identified the 4 strategies</b> that account for the most performance impact. These strategies have solved 80% of performance problems in most applications.</li>
        <li><b>Used more than 20 different SaaS providers</b>, performance-oriented <b>Rubygems</b>, backend <b>service providers and more</b> and found the perfect technical stack to make the entire performance optimization process simple (even if you’re a new developer or someone with a deep technical background).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        These strategies have been tested and proven. But not just on my client’s sites.
      </p>

      <p>
        While preparing this course, I’ve implemented each of my performance
        strategies on production websites like rubygems.org, sidekiq.org, the official
        Ruby website, and more.
      </p>

      <h4>Look over my shoulder while I work</h4>

      <p>
        You’ll get to watch, through screencasts and video lessons, exacty how
        (and more importantly, why) I optimized these real-world production websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Production websites will serve as your example</b> and guide to each and
        every one of the stratgies in this guide.
      </p>

      <p>
        Think of it as an opportunity to pair program with an experienced Rails
        developer and work on a high-scale application.
      </p>

      <h4>Easy-to-follow, even for bloated legacy apps</h4>

      <p>
        You’ll see the before and after, comparing the impact of each strategy
        through actual production metrics. It’s broken down into simple,
        step-by-step processes that cover every layer of a Rails application’s
        stack.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>At the end of each lesson is a simple checklist</b> so you can implement
        what you’ve learned. There’s no guesswork. Just follow the plan, and your
        performance analytics will start sloping down and to the right.

          <h4>Is there anyone I can reach out during the course if I have questions about my site in particular?</h4>
          <p>
            Yes. All course participants receive access to a private Slack
            channel where you can discuss problems and solutions. I'll be sitting
            in that channel all day. I do not have a day job - making your site
            faster is my job.

          <p>
            Yes. The software world changes quickly. Any changes to the course
            are free to you forever - you will never be asked to upgrade or buy
            "version two" or buy again when Rails 8 comes out.

          <h4>How much more is in the course vs. what you already put out on your blog?</h4>
          <p>
            About 25% of the material in the course is broadly covered by my blog. However, even for material that I've covered on the blog already, this course goes much further in depth and expands on those posts.

            Think of my blog as the introduction. This course is the college class.

            All videos, checklists and screencasts are all-new material.

          <h4>Do I need to be an advanced Rails programmer or Rubyist to understand this course?</h4>
          <p>
            No. This course assumes about 3 months of Rails experience, no more.
            I hate technical writing that assumes the reader is some kind of
            genius and doesn't explain (or even just link to an explanation)
            everything that's going on.

            In addition, even if you're not *completely* sure you've understood
            a topic, you can ask me and your fellow participants on our private
            Slack channel.

            Finally, if you buy the course and decide its over your head, I'll
            refund your money. No questions asked.

          <h4>I can't afford this course!</h4>
          <p>
            Think about it this way - can your business (or the business you work for) afford to be slow? Can you afford users quitting when they get frustrated with your site's speed?

            In 5 years, will you wish your site was slower? No. You'll wish it was faster.

            If you (or your customers) are not satisfied with the speed of your
            Rails application, this course will work for you. Not 100% will apply,
            of course, but 90% of it will.

          <h4>What stack will be covered? What about frontend JS frameworks?</h4>
          <p>
            I'm going to focus the course on the typical Rails stack. IMO, that
            includes a SQL relational database. NoSQL is too far outside of my
            comfort area to speak meaningfully about it. If a lot of people ask
            me for it, maybe I can bring in an outside expert for that or
            something. I include a specific section on Postgres, because
            it has several unique features and it's so widely used. JS frameworks
            - not specifically (I won't tell you how to optimize React,
            for example), but I will cover the specific needs of an API-only
            application.

          <h4>Is this course appropriate for legacy applications?</h4>
          <p>
            I've worked on a lot of what I consider "legacy" applications
            (2+ year codebases). Those are the ones that tend to be slow,
            not the greenfield ones, so I'd say this course *focuses* on legacy
            applications. My only caveat is I'm not going to talk about
            optimizing previous major versions of anything - Rails 3, Ruby
            1.9, etc.
